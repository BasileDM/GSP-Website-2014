					<li><strong>Hard</strong> and <strong>immersive</strong> survival</li>
					<li>Brand new <strong>gameplay/mechanics</strong></li>
					<li>Restrictive <strong>roleplay</strong> rules</li>
					<li><strong>Beauty</strong> of <strong>nature</strong> enhanced</li>
					<li>
						A lot of contents, all <strong>survival related</strong>,</br>
						and <strong>without overloading</strong>
					</li><!--GSP increases considerably the <strong>difficulty</strong> and enhances the <strong>survival</strong> and <strong>roleplay</strong> aspects without making you feel overwhelmed by contents. Even if there is a bunch of mods, i didn't want the player to feel lost, and the game to be overloaded/not coherent.-->

				<i>"I wanted to feel like surviving the wilderness, finding berries, building campfires to fight the cold, feel like the game is really hard and takes long to progress through. I wanted to find twigs among the leaves in the beginning, struggle for food, grow multiple crops, new minerals, new biomes, a more dangerous/beautiful nature and real hordes of zombies at night."</i>

				Every mod/plugin is configured, balanced, fixed and meant to be more than just a feature, but a real mechanic fitted to the gameplay. This is why i made a <a href="survival_guide.html">Survival Guide</a> on this website, some of the mods are working really differently than they are expected to.</br>
			</p>
			<p>
				I was greatly inspired by <a href="http://phedran.com/" target="_blank">Phedran</a> and her modpack <a href="http://phedran.com/LifeInTheWoods" target="_blank">"Life in the woods"</a>, which i took from a base to create GSP. So, if you know this modpack you won't be too lost and if you do not, you should check it out !

		<h2>Including a lot but so easy to install</h2>
		<article id="articlehome">
			<div id="screen4">
				<p><a href="images/installer.jpg"><img src="images/thumb12.jpg" alt="Screenshot" title="Click to enlarge"/></a></p>
			</div>	
			<p id="articlehomespe5">
				<b>GSP includes an auto-installer.</b> You don't even need to open your .minecraft folder yourself. The installation is made as easy as possible, just follow the steps.
			</p>
			<p>
				GSP also allows you to install Optifine, the Shader mod and some shaders, really easily even if they are not included.</br>
				Also, a sound pack is implemented to increase the immersion.

		<h2 id="singleplayer">Play solo, but not single player !</h2>
		<article id="articlehome44">
			<div id="screen5">
				<p><a href="images/manager.jpg"><img src="images/thumb11.jpg" alt="Screenshot" title="Click to enlarge"/></a></p>
			</div>
			<div id="screen6">
				<p><img src="images/multiplayer.jpg" alt="Multiplayer button"/></p>
			</div>
			<p id="articlehomespe6">
				<b>GSP is a mod AND plugin pack</b> for Minecraft. And as it uses plugins, it's meant to be played on <b>server only</b>. But you can play solo of course, and thanks to the manager, you can launch Minecraft and a server at the same time without any knowledge, in one click.
			</p>
			<p id="articlehomespe7">
				<b>So do not launch a Singleplayer game.</b> It won't crash, but as the plugins are not active the game will lack some of its main features. It is one of the cons, but a pro too, because it's ready to be played with friends without being worried about any complicated manipulation.</br>

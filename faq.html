			<h2 id="forge">Forge has failed installing</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				If when clicking the "Install Forge" button, Forge sends an error message, you have to start again all the installation from the beginning. Sorry for the inconvenience, but it happens sometimes (pretty rarely) and as the installation is quick, it should be fine. It comes from forge servers and there is nothing i can do for it.
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="164">Minecraft 1.6.4 is not detected</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				Did you select "Use version : Release 1.6.4" in "Edit profile" ? Be sure to do all the installation steps exactly as they're described.
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="doc">It opens "my documents"</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				If the installer is opening the "My documents" folder instead of a mod or shader folder, you didn't install GSP correctly. Be sure to follow all the steps as they are described.
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="server">The server won't start</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				If your server is not launching, there is a few explanations. Sometimes if your memory is low, the server will not start. Be sure to close a maximum of open applications, and try again several times. Even try to restart your computer if you feel like it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another possibility is that your version of java is not installed in the 64 bits pathway. In the manager, go in the "options" menu, click the Java logo and select "32 bits" to make the server work with java 32 bit version.
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="launch">Minecraft won't launch</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				If your minecraft goes back to the launcher or crashes when you try to start it, you should try to re-install GSP.
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="crash">My game keeps crashing</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				If the game or the server keeps crashing, be sure you didn't install any additional mods or updated some of them. You should also try to remove optifine which can cause a slow terrain generation and lead to a server crash. You may have also installed a client side mod ( Like optifine or the shader mod) on your server.
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="playoff">I can only "Play Offline"</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				If in the Minecraft launcher, you only have the option to "Play Offline", this is totally independent of GSP. Minecraft servers are experiencing troubles or your connection is limited. Try <a href="http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/minecraft.net.html" target="_blank">this website</a> to see if Minecraft.net servers are down.
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="smart">My character is dismembered</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				It happens when you change your shader pack. Try to restart the game and it should good.
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="drink">I can't drink anywhere</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				Be sure to aim at the immerged side of a non-water block when right clicking. Your hand has to be empty too. <a href="survival_guide.html#thirst">Thirst tutorial</a>
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="craft">I can't craft the...</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				If there is something you can't craft, be sure to check out the <a href="survival_guide.html#recipes">"New/Disabled recipes"</a> section of the survival guide. This is not a bug.
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="animals">There are no animals</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				Did you launch the game to the main menu in vanilla 1.6.4 ? This is an important step of the installation instructions. Be sure to read them entirely.
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="farm">My cows (or else) have despawn</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				Did you put torches nearby ? This is specified in the <a href="survival_guide.html#breeding">"Breeding"</a> section of the survival guide.
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="lag">I'm lagging so bad</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				If you are experiencing some lags, there is a few things you can do :
			</p>
			<p>
				First, for those who are playing solo, go to the "Options" menu in the GSP console manager and click on "Server folder". It will open your current server folder. Open the "server.properties" file with any text editor and change the line "ip=" to "ip=127.0.0.1". The other players won't be able to join you but it should decrease the lags. You can also right click on the "server folder" icon and click "Open source folder". If you change something in this folder, all the new server you create when reseting will have these properties.
			</p>
			<p>
				Restarting the server every 30 minutes is recommended and should fix the lags for a moment. If you start exploring, the terrain generation can cause lags, this is why i implemented the <a href="downloads.html#worldborder">"World Border"</a> plugin in order to load the world before playing thanks to its /fill function.
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="terraingen">The terrain generation is slow (and buggy ?)</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				Try to get rid of Optifine it slows the terrain generation. You can also try to use the "/fill" function of the "World Border" plugin <a href="downloads.html#worldborder">(Tutorial here)</a>. You can also press "F3 + A" to refresh the terrain !
			</p>
		</article>
			<h2 id="afterdeath">My friends see me glitchy</h2>
		<article>
			<p>
				When you die, the following things will happen : In the beginning you only have 6 hearts but after a death, you will respawn with all your hearts. Most of them will be empty and, of course, you will not be able to regen entirely. You will not be slowed down when low health and other players will see you flying and glitchy. To solve all this, you just have to disconnect and reconnect.
			</p>
			<p>
				The other possibility is that your friends changed of shader pack. They have to restart the game.
